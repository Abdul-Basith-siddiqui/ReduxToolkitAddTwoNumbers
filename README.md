# Simple Redux-ToolKit WebApp which add two numbers

# components 

The Add component is a form that allows a user to input two numbers, and then adds them together when the user clicks the "ADD" button.

The Add component has a state object called num that has three properties: num1, num2, and ans. num1 and num2 are the two input numbers, and ans is the sum of those two numbers and  has a changeHandle function that updates the num state object whenever the user inputs a new value into the form fields.

When the user clicks the "ADD" button, the Add component dispatches the showData action from the showSlice slice with the num1 and num2 values as the payload. This updates the show slice of the Redux store with the new values of num1 and num2.

The AddNum component is a functional component that displays the sum of num1 and num2 from the Redux store. It uses the useSelector hook to get the show slice of the Redux store, and then displays the sum of first and second, which are the updated values of num1 and num2 from the show slice.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
